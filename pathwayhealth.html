        <h1>Pathway Health Overview</h1>
        <h2>End-to-End Mobile App Case Study</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a one-stop app for users to access lab results, make appointments,
          and connect with a community.</p>
        <p>Role: Jr. UX/UI Designer (solo)</p>
        <p>Duration: 6 months</p>
        <p>Tools: Pen and Paper, Figma, Canva</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <div class="pathway-health">
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>This app was created with anxious users in mind. Many users experience anxiety caused by waiting for lab
            results, the next appointment for a doctor’s diagnosis, and treatment plans. With this in mind, I wanted to
            create an app to make the user (caretaker)’s life easier.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <div class="pathway-health">
        <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>The goal of the research is to understand the user's general attitude towards waiting for a loved one's lab
          results as well as the pain points that users have surrounding health and how the app can meet those needs.
        </p>

          <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Where do you get your health knowledge when you don't understand a certain health topic?</li>
            <li>Have you experienced wanting to expedite a lab results because of worries or fears towards a loved one's
              health?</li>
            <li>What was your initial reaction when you received a health scare?</li>
            <li>Did you have a positive healthcare experience?</li>
            <li>What feature from a health app have you used before that you particularly enjoyed?</li>
            <li>How often do you visit the doctors?</li>
            <li>How often do you think about your health?</li>
            <li>How old are you?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Most user's initial response to any health scare about themselves or their loved ones is to respond in
              fear</li>
            <li>The pain point for some users is not knowing what to do during the waiting period</li>
            <li>People come from different backgrounds and have varying degrees of health knowledge</li>
            <li>The more information a user knows about their health, they might respond by seeking medical attention
              more quickly rather than responding in fear only</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>After collecting the interview data, I created a persona to define the problem and hypothesis.</p>

      <h2>User Flows</h2>
      <p>Main Flow: Users can make an appointment, search and save articles, and save card information on account to
        make the payment process easier to access.</p>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>I chose to use pen and paper (grid lines) for my lo-fidelity wireframe as I wanted to jot down the ideas that
        immediately came to mind. I felt grid lines would better capture the frame and makes it easier to align
        things. I wanted to capture the idea that comes since paper is easy to create and modify. I can also get more
        creative since I’m not stressed over the small details or learning how to navigate the software. Therefore, I
        decided to use pen and paper for my lo-fidelity wireframes.</p>

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>Participants & Schedule: There will be 6 participants in the usability study and they are each from a
        different background. <br>Methodology: The usability test will be moderated in-person at various locations.
        Results are recorded through a voice recording app. The test were done on participants who had experience with
        any kind of healthcare app. <br>Goal: To check the app's usability, usefulness, and efficiency. We will
        determine if additional features need to be included or excluded to provide users with a better experience to
        lessen their already piling stress from incessant health appointments. </p>
      <p>Issue 1: The Home page has no substantial function and some features do not make sense <br>Proposed Change:
        change the homepage to the message center. </p>

      <h2>Final Learnings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This project gave me a glimpse to how many users who have experienced health scare towards their loved
          ones out of a desire to spend longer time with them</li>
        <li>I learned that I had a tendency to be design oriented rather than focusing on the user and their needs - I
          needed to come back to the user and the problem repeatedly</li>

    </div>
    <div class="pathway-health">
      <h2>What can I do better next time?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Get better at scheduling interviews ahead of time as coordinating the interviews took longer than expected
        </li>
        <li>Explore different tools to help enhance user experience</li>
        <li>Include more usability tests after each prototype revisions</li>
